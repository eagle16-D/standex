Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol built on the Ethereum
blockchain that facilitates automated trading of cryptocurrencies through the
use of smart contracts. Here’s a breakdown of its key features and how you can
use it to build a DEX with a copy trading feature:

### What is Uniswap?

1. **Decentralized Exchange**: Uniswap operates without a central authority,
   allowing users to trade Ethereum-based tokens directly from their wallets.
2. **Automated Market Maker (AMM)**: Instead of using order books, Uniswap
   employs liquidity pools where users can add or withdraw liquidity. Prices
   are determined algorithmically based on the ratio of tokens in these pools.
3. **Smart Contracts**: All transactions on Uniswap are handled by smart
   contracts, ensuring trustless and transparent trading.
4. **ERC-20 Tokens**: Uniswap supports all tokens adhering to the ERC-20
   standard, which is the most common token standard on the Ethereum network.

### Use Uniswap to Build a DEX?

1. **Forking the Code**: Uniswap’s code is open source, so you can fork it from
   GitHub. This allows you to create a similar DEX tailored to your specific
   requirements.
2. **Customization**: Modify the code to suit your branding, token listings,
   fee structures, and other preferences.
3. **Deploying Smart Contracts**: You'll need to deploy your modified smart
   contracts on the Ethereum network (or another compatible blockchain if you
   adapt the protocol).
4. **Frontend Development**: Develop a user interface that interacts with your
   smart contracts, providing a seamless user experience for trading.

### Implementing a Copy Trading Feature

1. **Trader Profiles**: Create profiles for expert traders who wish to share
   their trades with followers.
2. **Smart Contracts for Copy Trading**: Develop smart contracts that can track
   and replicate the trades of these expert profiles. These contracts should:
   - Follow trades in real-time or at regular intervals.
   - Allocate funds proportionally based on the follower’s capital.
3. **User Interface**: Enhance your DEX’s interface to support copy trading
   features. This includes:
   - Allowing users to select traders to follow.
   - Displaying performance metrics of traders.
   - Providing options to manage followed trades, such as adjusting the
     replication ratio or stopping the copy trading.
4. **Security and Transparency**: Ensure that the copy trading mechanism is
   secure and transparent. Users should have visibility into how trades are being
   executed and the performance of their investments.
5. **Compliance**: Depending on your jurisdiction, make sure your platform
   complies with relevant financial regulations concerning copy trading and user
   fund management.

### Example Workflow

1. **User A (Expert Trader)** places a trade on your DEX.
2. **Smart Contract** records this trade and signals the copy trading contract.
3. **User B (Follower)** has opted to copy User A’s trades.
4. **Copy Trading Smart Contract** automatically replicates User A’s trade for
   User B, according to the predetermined parameters (e.g., trade size
   proportional to User B’s investment).
